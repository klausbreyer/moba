A handy little plugin for batch uploading pictures from your mobile phone into a wordpress posting.
This is useful, because the mobile app often have some hickups when uploading a lot or large (or both) pictures. Through this plugin you can upload all of them from your mobile browser. 

Given that you have LTE or a stable Wifi, there should be no hickups.
